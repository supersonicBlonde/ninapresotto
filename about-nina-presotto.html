              Where It All Started
            </h3>
            <p>
              Trained at <strong>L’École Multimédia in Paris in 2001</strong>, I
              entered the web world when dial-up tones were still the norm and
              building a website meant hand-coding every page.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="my-8">
            <h3
              class="text-earth-500 font-bold mb-2 text-lg uppercase font-MontreuxBrandingBold"
            >
              Curiosity from the start
            </h3>
            <p>
              As a kid, I was already drawn to screens — spending hours on
              Donkey Kong and Space Invaders on my Colecovision. A few years
              later, I joined the computer club at school and wrote my first
              programs in BASIC, discovering how satisfying it was to make
              something come alive on a screen. By the time the web arrived,
              that foundation made it almost natural to move from simple command
              lines to building my first websites, and eventually into a career
              crafting the kind of digital experiences I used to daydream about.

              class="text-earth-500 font-bold mb-2 text-lg uppercase font-MontreuxBrandingBold"
            >
              Early projects and early Lessons
            </h3>
            <p>
              Some of my earliest collaborations were with iconic Paris
              nightclubs — Les Bains Douches, Le Studio 287 — and most of those
              sites were designed in Flash, where experimentation set the rules.
              That period pushed me to understand clients quickly, translate
              bold ideas into functional experiences, and constantly find
              solutions when tools were limited.

              Growing with the Industry
            </h3>
            <p>
              I then moved through small creative studios and growing tech
              teams, learning how to balance design, usability, and technical
              constraints. Later, working abroad with international teams
              expanded my perspective, sharpening my adaptability and my focus
              on how people actually use digital products.

              Two Decades of Evolution and Expertise
            </h3>
            <p>
              Today, as a freelance web developer, I bring more than two decades
              of experience, a self-taught progression beyond the basics learned
              at school, and the perspective of someone who has witnessed the
              web evolve from its earliest days. Because technology moves fast,
              I’ve always kept pace — learning continuously, refining my
              methods, and staying hands-on. Clients come to me not just for
              code, but for guidance, structure, and a smooth, reassuring
              process.

              A Human Approach to Technology
            </h3>
            <p class="md:max-w-lg my-4">
              I enjoy helping entrepreneurs and companies feel confident about
              their digital presence and make technology less intimidating. My
              work remains straightforward: build reliable, scalable, and
              effective websites that support real business goals, while keeping
              communication clear and human throughout the journey.
